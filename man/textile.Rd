\title{Textile data on breaking strength by starch type and chip thickness}
\format{
A data frame with 49 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
  \item{strength}{the response, the breaking strength.}
  \item{film}{the chip's film thickness, measured in 10^-4 inches.}
  \item{starch}{the chip's starch component: canna, corn, or potato}
}
}
\usage{
data(textile)
}
\description{
Furry (1939) analyzes the breaking strength of a starch chip
as a function of the chipâ€™s thickness (measured in 10^-4 inches) and the type
of plant from which the starch was derived (corn, canna, or potato).
